          A great day out for family and friends or a 
          short relaxing trip for as little as an hour
      </h3>
      <p class="lead-text">
          It couldnʼt be easier, choose from one of our two boatyards, located in Thames Ditton (near Ye Olde Swan) and Surbiton (behind Harts Boatyard Restaurant), pick a boat and after a brief introduction to the simple controls just cruise away and enjoy the River Thames at your leisure.

          Located on a fabulous stretch of the river in South West London, Ditton Cruisers puts you at the helm of their well maintained day boats. Explore famous locations such as historic Hampton Court, the old market town of Kingston upon Thames, picturesque Hampton or Sunbury or simply find one of a number of idyllic spots to moor up and have a picnic…the choice is yours.
